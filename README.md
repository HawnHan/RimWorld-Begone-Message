# Begone, Message!
You know those messages on food rotting and relations decaying and so forth that annoyingly block some of the colonist bar at the top?

This mod allows you to:
* Dismiss a message by right-clicking that message.
* Dismiss all messages by shift-right-clicking any message.

## Compatibility
Should be safe to add and remove from existing save games.

Should be compatible with other mods.
